WPBo Naked Wordpress Theme Bootstrap by Closemarketing
=========================================================

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) in WordPress theme form.

Used Eddie Machado's Bones for a starting point (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) but it doesn't look too much like it any longer.

Forked from Wordpress Bootstrap Theme (https://github.com/320press/wordpress-bootstrap)

FEATURES
________

We’ve built the WP Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is as a very basic theme or as a starting point for theme developers. It’s built on top of the Bones theme framework by Eddie Machado and based on v3.3.4 of Bootstrap.

Watch or star this project to keep up with its progress.

Multi-Lingual
_____________

WP-Bootstrap is translated in 4 languages - Spanish, French, Portuguese and German.

Page Templates
______________

We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Homepage template
    - Standard page with right sidebar (this page)
    - Page with left sidebar
    - Full width page
    - Page without title

Theme Options Panel
___________________

We don't believe in Options Panels. This theme is for developers that don't need a Options page. We want the theme as cleanest as possible.

Shortcodes

We’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Bootstrap.
