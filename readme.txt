== Description ==
We’ve built the WP Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is as a very basic theme or as a starting point for theme developers. It’s built on top of the Bones theme framework by Eddie Machado and based on v3.3.6 of Bootstrap.

Watch or star this project to keep up with its progress.

We recommend to use this theme as parent (https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) and make changes in Child Theme like WPBO child. (https://github.com/closemarketing/wpbo-child)

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the 'Add New' button.
2. Type in WPBO in the search form and press the 'Enter' key in your keyboard.
3. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
